# CampusConnect â€“ A Java OOP Based Academic Profile System

**CampusConnect** is a lightweight console-based application designed using **Core Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It models a real-world academic environment by managing student profiles based on their level of study: Bachelorâ€™s, Masterâ€™s, and PhD.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Object-Oriented design using **abstraction**, **inheritance**, **interfaces**, and **polymorphism**
- Individual handling for:
  - **Bachelor students** (with project work)
  - **Master students** (with conference participation)
  - **PhD students** (with conferences + published articles)
- Modular code for easy extension and testing
- Accurate total score calculation based on unique student types

## ðŸ“¦ Code Structure

- `Student` *(abstract class)*: Common fields like `id`, `midterm`, `final`, and score calculation base
- Interfaces:
  - `ProjectScoreBehaviour`
  - `ConferenceScoreBehaviour`
  - `ArticleScoreBehaviour`
- Inheriting classes:
  - `BachelorStudent`
  - `MasterStudent`
  - `PhDStudent`
- `CampusConnectApp`: The entry point that simulates creation and scoring of different student types
